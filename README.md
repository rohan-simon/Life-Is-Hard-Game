# Life is Hard in the Sea

## Description
You play as a humble fish who must outlast the dangers of the sea for 3 days. These dangers become considerably greater as the time progresses. In addition to the onslaught of the treacherous hurdles created by humans, you may also find yourself facing other horrors of the sea. Will you survive…

We were impressed by the game’s elegance, well-executed implementation, and lively art and animation. The overall cohesiveness of these elements together moved us to award this recognition.
