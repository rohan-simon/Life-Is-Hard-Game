# Life is Hard in the Sea

## Description
You play as a humble fish who must outlast the dangers of the sea for 3 days. These dangers become considerably greater as the time progresses. In addition to the onslaught of the treacherous hurdles created by humans, you may also find yourself facing other horrors of the sea. Will you survive…

**Won the Judge's Choice Award at the Oregon Game Project Challenge.**

Here were the comments from the judges - industry professionals from Microsoft and various game development firms:

> "Life Is Hard In The Sea greets you with vibrant visuals and a charismatic protagonist. If you connect with this little fish you might find yourself moved by its persistence. We were impressed by the game’s elegance, well-executed implementation, and lively art and animation. The overall cohesiveness of these elements together moved us to award this recognition. We look forward to seeing what Eclipse and its members do next!"

All game files (scene design, sprite-handling scripts, physics scripts etc.) can be found in this repository.

Developed by Team Eclipse, led by Rohan Simon Shanthanu.
